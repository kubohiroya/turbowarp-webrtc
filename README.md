# turbowarp-webrtc

Manual WebRTC DataChannel pairing for TurboWarp. This extension is intended as the low-level peer transport for TM Kamishibai and similar physical-event runtimes.

## Goals

- No persistent signaling server.
- Manual offer/answer pairing by copy/paste or QR code.
- DataChannel-only messaging.
- LAN-first ICE configuration by default.
- JSON event envelopes with a receive queue.
- Multiple named peers.

## Pairing Flow

1. On the host project, run `create offer code for peer [PEER]`.
2. Copy `offer code for peer [PEER]` to the joining project.
3. On the joining project, run `accept offer code [CODE] as peer [PEER]`.
4. Copy `answer code for peer [PEER]` back to the host project.
5. On the host project, run `accept answer code [CODE] for peer [PEER]`.
6. Send events after the connection state becomes `connected`.

## Message Format

`send event` serializes payloads as JSON envelopes:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "id": "uuid",
  "seq": 1,
  "from": "local-id",
  "channel": "default",
  "type": "door-open",
  "payload": {"pin": 1},
  "timestamp": 1787616000000
}
```

Received messages include an additional `peer` field.
