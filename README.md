# turbowarp-webrtc

Manual WebRTC DataChannel pairing for TurboWarp. This extension is intended as the low-level peer transport for TM Kamishibai and similar physical-event runtimes.

## Goals

- No persistent signaling server.
- Manual offer/answer pairing by copy/paste or QR code.
- DataChannel-only messaging.
- LAN-first ICE configuration by default.
- JSON event envelopes with a receive queue.
- Multiple named peers.
- TurboWarp hat blocks for received network messages.

## Runtime Requirements

This extension must run as an unsandboxed extension. It uses WebRTC DataChannel APIs for transport and TurboWarp VM runtime APIs to start network message hat blocks. Loading it as a sandboxed extension fails at startup.

## Pairing Flow

1. On the host project, run `create offer code for peer [PEER]`.
2. Copy `offer code for peer [PEER]` to the joining project.
3. On the joining project, run `accept offer code [CODE] as peer [PEER]`.
4. Copy `answer code for peer [PEER]` back to the host project.
5. On the host project, run `accept answer code [CODE] for peer [PEER]`.
6. Send events after the connection state becomes `connected`.

## Network Broadcasts

`broadcast network message [MESSAGE] payload [PAYLOAD] channel [CHANNEL] to peer [PEER]` sends a message to a peer using the existing JSON envelope format. Set `PEER` to `*` to send to every connected peer.

On the receiving side, `when I receive network message [MESSAGE]` starts matching scripts. `MESSAGE` is matched against the received envelope's `type`. A hat with `MESSAGE` set to `*` acts as a catch-all handler for every network message.

Hat scripts can read the received message with these reporters:

- `network message payload`: returns the payload as a JSON string.
- `network message sender`: returns the sender's local ID.
- `network message peer`: returns the peer name used by this connection.
- `network message channel`: returns the envelope channel.

There is no `broadcast ... and wait` equivalent yet. Waiting for remote scripts to finish requires an ACK/completion protocol, so it is treated as a separate feature from regular network broadcast delivery.

## Message Format

`send event` and `broadcast network message` serialize payloads as JSON envelopes:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "id": "uuid",
  "seq": 1,
  "from": "local-id",
  "channel": "default",
  "type": "door-open",
  "payload": {"pin": 1},
  "timestamp": 1787616000000
}
```

Received messages include an additional `peer` field.
